\section{Data sources}
\section{Recruitment}

In this section, the latest trends in glass and yellow eel recruitment are
addressed. The time-series data are derived from fishery-dependent sources
(i.e. catch records) and also from fishery-independent surveys across much of
the geographic range of European eel.  The
stages are categorized as :
\begin{itemize}
\item glass eel (G), continental age 0 years, 
\item a mixture of glass eel and young
yellow eel dominated by recruits from the same year (GY), and
\item older yellow eel (Y) recruiting to continental habitats. The yellow
eel series might consist of yellow eel of several ages.
This is certainly the case for all series from the Baltic (mean age up to 6),
 some Irish sites, and sites located far upstream.
\end{itemize}
The glass eel recruitment time-series have been grouped into two geographical
areas: 'continental North Sea' (NS) and 'Elsewhere Europe' (EE) (Figure
\ref{figure1}). The glass eel recruitment time-series have been grouped into two geographical
areas: 'continental North Sea' (NS) and 'Elsewhere Europe' (EE) (Figure 3.4.1).
Previous analyses by the working group (ICES, 2010b, p19, Bornarel et al. (2017) 
have shown a different trend between the two sets. This is mostly due to a more pronounced
decline of the North Sea series compared to the Elsewhere Europe area during the 1980s.

The WGEEL has collated information on recruitment from
$95$ time-series. Some time-series date back to the
beginning of 20th century (yellow eel, Gota Alv, Sweden) or 1920 (glass eel,
Loire, France). Among those series $68$ have been
selected for further analysis in the wgeel indices; see details on data
selection and processing below. Depending on the standardization period, the number of series  used can be lower and is given for
each analysis. 

%==================================================

G and GY) yellow = Y.}
\label{figure1}
\end{figure}
%==========================================

\subsection{Details on data selection and processing}

Out of $95$, 
$68$ series were used in the analysis. Three
rules have been used for this selection procedure.
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, if there are two or more series from the same location, i.e. they are not independent,only one series is kept. For instance, the longer series has been kept for the Severn (Severn EA) while the other series (Severn HMRC) has been dropped from the list, as it was considered a duplicate being based on the same fishery.Noting that the 'Severn' here actually represents all the glass eel fisheries for England and Wales but the naming convention has been used for many
years so is retained for consistency.
\textcolor{Plum}{TODO work on Minho sp and Minho
pt. and Gironde....}
\item The second rule is to exclude a series from the analysis when it is less than ten years long. The series are, however, still updated in the database until they are long enough to be included. \textcolor{Plum}{But clarify now what we are going to do
when there are missing years....} 
\item Finally, it was decided to discard recruitment series that were obviously biased by restocking (e.g. Farpener Bach in Germany).
\end{enumerate}


Among the time-series based on trap indices, some have reported
preliminary data for 2020 as their trapping season had not
finished. \textbf{As usual, the indices given for 2020 must be considered
as provisional especially those for the yellow eel.}

\subsection{Check on series updates for the 2019 analyses[remove this paragraph]}

$41$ time-series  updated to 2020 
$25$ for glass eel \\ 
$9$ forglass + yellow eel  \\
and $7$ for yellow eel \\
$12$ time-series (0 for glass eel,
$3$ for glass + yellow eel and
$9$ for yellow eel) were updated to 2019
only (Table \ref{table_seriesCYm1})).  

$15$ time-series have been stopped or not updated
beyond 2016 ($13$ for glass eel,
$2$ for glass eel + yellow eel and
0 for yellow eel (Table
\ref{table_serieslost})) but are still included in the analysis.
Some have stopped reporting either because of a lack of recruits in the case of
the fishery-based surveys (Ems in Germany, stopped in 2001; Vidaa in Denmark, stopped in 1990),
 a lack of financial support (the Tiber in Italy, 2006) or the introduction of
quota from from 2008 to 2011 that has disrupted the five fishery-based French
time-series . The two English series (FlaE and BeeG) are still operating but
data have not been updated since 2016.

\subsection{Raw data}
 
Calculation of the geometric mean of all time-series \footnote{This figure is given as it
consistent with the trend provided by WGEEL from 2002 to 2006. The scaling is
performed on the 1979-1994 average of each time-series, and 24 time-series without data during that
period are excluded from the analysis. The time-series left out are :
BeeG, BresGY, BroG, BroY, DoElY, FlaG, FreY, GirnY, GreyGY, GuadG, HellGY, InagGY, KlitG, MaigG, MolY, NmiGY, NorsG, OriaG, RodY, SleG, VacG, VerlGY, WiFG, WisWGY}. \\

\label{figure4}
\end{figure}
%==========================================


\subsection{GLM based trend}

The WGEEL recruitment index used in the ICES Annual Stock Advice is fitted using
a GLM (Generalised Linear Model) with gamma distribution and a log link:
$glass~eel \sim year:area + site $, where $glass~eel$ is individual glass eel
time-series, including both pure G series and those identified as a mixture of
glass and yel-low eel (G+Y), $site$ is the site monitored for recruitment,
area is either the continental North Sea or Elsewhere Europe, and year is the
year coded as a categorical value.
For yellow eel time-series, only one estimate is provided:
$yellow~eel \sim year + site $. 

The trend is hindcast using the predictions from 1960 onwards for
52 glass eel time-series and from 1950 onwards for
16 yellow eel time-series.
Some zero values have been excluded from the GLM analysis: 
17 for the glass eel model and
21 for the yellow eel model. This
treatment is parcimoniuous and tests shows it has no effect on the trend (ICES,
2017).\\

The reconstructed values are then aggregated using geometric means of the two
reference area (Elsewhere Europe EE, and North Sea NS). The predictions are given 
in reference to the geometric mean of the 1960-1979 period.
Note that the shift from arithmetic to geometric means was done this year
because \textit{post-hoc} model checking confirmed that log-normal (or Gamma
Distribution) and geometric means are the prefered choice. \\

As some of the values were not complete the 2018, the
level of European eel recruitment compared to the 1960-1979 average has changed 
when compared to last year report. The value has decreased from 9.6\% in last
year report to $5.6$\% for the Elsewhere Europe area.  It remains unchanged 
 for the North Sea at $1.4$\%.
 For 2019, data are \textbf{only provisional} and give estimates at
 $0.5$\% for the North Sea and $6.5$\% for the
Elsewhere Europe area, but some of the series are not yet complete (Figure
\ref{figure5} \ref{figure5_with_logscale} (log.scale), Tables \ref{table_glm_glass_eel}).

  52 time-series comprising either pure glass eel or a mixture of 
  glass eels and yellow eels. The predictions $p$ have been scaled to the 1960-1979
  average $\bar{p}_{1960-1979}$. In the Baltic area, recruitment occurs in the yellow eel stage only.}

For yellow eel series, the autumn ascent has not been recorded yet and most of

index is at $17$\% of
the 1960-1979 baseline.

\subsection{Is there a positive trend in recruitment ?}
After high levels in the late 1970s, the recruitment declined and has been very
low for all years after 2000. From ICES (2014) onward a change in the
recruitment has been detected. One of the test used to show that change in 2014
was based on SGIPEE(2011) working group. We have used a test only slighly
different from the test used in ICES 2011. The difference is that the model is
now based on individual series as source data, not only the prediction. The model differs from that used by
wgeel also as year is here treated as a continuous value, whereas it is treated
as a factor in the glm for recruitment, and the years are restricted to
decreasing part of the recruitment (after 1980).
\begin{equation}
glass~eel \sim  \alpha_{site} site + \beta_{area} Y_{>=1980} + \gamma_{area} Y_{>2011} + \epsilon,
\end{equation}
where glass eel is the number of glass eel in the glass eel series, either for the Elsewhere Europe or the North Sea time series, $year_{year>1980}$
is a continuous value corresponding to year after 1980, $year_{year>2011}$ is also
a continuous value, $\epsilon$ is a random error with mean 0 and standard deviation sigma, 
and $\alpha_{site}$, $\beta_{area}$ and $\gamma_{area}$ are the estimated
parameters. The parameters $\gamma_{area}$ are higly significant both in the
Elsewhere Europe area (p=$2e-12$
and for the North Sea p=$1e-21$ North Sea.
This result confirms that there has been a change in the recruitment slope.

\textcolor{purple}{Add a table with past coeff, current coeff, and probabilities and diminish the text}

To test whether there is an increase in recruitment since 2011 the slope of
$\beta_{area}+\gamma_{area}$, i.e. the slope of the recent increase in
recruitment is positive, the NULL hypothesis $H0:b>0$ is tested.

To summarize, after high levels in the late 1970s, the recruitment declined and has been very
low for all years after 2000. There has been a change in the trend in 2011, the
recruitment has stopped to decrease, and has been increasing in the period
2011-2019 with a rate significantly different from zero. However,  this increase needs
to be taken very carefully. Firstly , not all series have been reported for 2019
and the results might change  when missing data is incorporated to the analysis. 
Secondly, even if the results would not change, recruitment remains very low
$0.5$\% for the North Sea 
and $6.5$\% for the
Elsewhere Europe area. Recruitment has been continually decreasing
from 1980 to 2011 (31 years), thus, the positive trend should be maintained during more years in order
to consider that the stock is safe. In that sense and finally,  during the 2011-2019 period, 
the maximum values were reached in 2014; but recruitment has been decreasing
since then.
