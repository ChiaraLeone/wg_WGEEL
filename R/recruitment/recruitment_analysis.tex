% Sweave script for wgeel recruitment analysis
% Author Cedric Briand / Estibaliz Diaz
% you can run this script with command sweave() or appropriate tools
% such as Eclipse or Rstudio
% this script is intended to run with sweave not knitr
% It produces a nice pdf which has to be turned into a less nice word document
% The problem is that the encoding of my files is Cp1252
% The only way out is a full shift to utf8, in init pass locale for R to Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "English_United States.932")
% In the preamble replace \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc} by \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% Note the following does not work :
% iconv -f CP1252 -t UTF-8 recruitment_analysis.tex > recruitment_analysis_utf8.tex
% finally the command to run is : 
% cd C:\workspace\gitwgeel\R\recruitment
% pandoc -s -o recruitment.docx --from=latex --to=docx  recruitment_analysis.tex
% All this for producing a ugly word report :-(
