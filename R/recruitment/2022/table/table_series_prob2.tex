  MeusY & Y & BE & 27.4.c & 2021 &   3 & In 2021 up to 10 July, 387 eels were caught (biomass 15544 g). Sizes of eels caught ranged from 10.7 cm to 63.2 cm (median 26.2 cm). Maximum CPUE was 117 individuals per day. This observed number of eels caught has been impacted by the delay in the maintenance cleaning of the fish pass  due to the covid-19 pandemic. It includes both wild and restocked eels. The monitoring of this fish pass started on 4 June 2021. These definitive will remain incomplete because the fish pass has not been functional since the serious floods from July 14 to 16, 2021 which affected Wallonia and completely blocked the pools of the fish pass. \\
