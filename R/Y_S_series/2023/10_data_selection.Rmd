### Data selection

In the 2023 data call, `r length(unique(data$ser_nameshort))` silver eel time series were available, located in `r length(unique(data$ser_cou_code[!is.na(data$ser_cou_code)]))` countries (Figure \@ref(fig:mapsilverall)). The majority of these series are from Lithuania (`r length(unique(data$ser_nameshort[data$ser_cou_code == "LT" & !is.na(data$ser_cou_code)]))` series), Netherlands (`r length(unique(data$ser_nameshort[data$ser_cou_code == "NL" & !is.na(data$ser_cou_code)]))` series), United Kingdom (`r length(unique(data$ser_nameshort[data$ser_cou_code == "GB" & !is.na(data$ser_cou_code)]))` series) and France (`r length(unique(data$ser_nameshort[data$ser_cou_code == "FR" & !is.na(data$ser_cou_code)]))` series). Four time series (BI1S, BI4S, NSIS, PanS) are international trawling surveys. Data on these silver eel time series have been added to the WGEEL database in the past, but as these international series have no dedicated reporting country, their data have not been updated by any country in the database since 2011.

A summary of the type of data available in the silver eel time series is given in Table \@ref(tab:table-summary) and Figure \@ref(fig:figure-seriessummary), and a detailed summary of all the series is presented in **Annex x.x**. From all available silver eel time series, `r nrow(t.filterchoice[t.filterchoice$n >= min.length,])` series have `r min.length` or more years of available data. Only `r sum(d.effort.available$effort)` of the `r length(unique(data$ser_nameshort))` series have effort data submitted. Most silver eel series were collected in freshwaters via traps and fyke nets. In terms of sampling type, `r nrow(d.tablesummary[d.tablesummary$sam_samplingtype == "commercial catch",])` series were from commercial catches, `r nrow(d.tablesummary[d.tablesummary$sam_samplingtype == "commercial CPUE",])` series were reported as commercial CPUE, `r nrow(d.tablesummary[d.tablesummary$sam_samplingtype == "trapping all",])` were assigned as full trapping series, `r nrow(d.tablesummary[d.tablesummary$sam_samplingtype == "trapping partial",])` as partial trapping series, and `r nrow(d.tablesummary[d.tablesummary$sam_samplingtype == "scientific estimate",])` were classified as scientific estimate, with `r nrow(d.tablesummary[is.na(d.tablesummary$sam_samplingtype),])` series missing this information. When it comes to the series quality ID, `r nrow(d.tablesummary[d.tablesummary$ser_qal_id == 1,])` series had a quality ID of 1, indicating good quality, `r nrow(d.tablesummary[d.tablesummary$ser_qal_id == 0,])` had a quality ID of 0, indicating that it had been previously decided that the series should not be used in an analysis (usually because there were not enough years of data), and `r nrow(d.tablesummary[is.na(d.tablesummary$ser_qal_id),])` series were missing a series quality ID. For the next WGEEL meeting, these series quality IDs should be reconsidered, given the large amount of series without a series quality ID, and the fact that some series with a quality ID of 0 now have at least 10 years of data. Almost all series had information on the potential impacts of restocking, with `r sum(d.tablesummary$ser_restocking, na.rm = T)` series classified as being influenced by restocking and `r sum(!d.tablesummary$ser_restocking, na.rm = T)` as not being influenced by restocking. 

The decision was made to perform the trend analysis with only those silver eel time series that had at least `r min.length` years of data available. After examining the `r length(unique(data$ser_nameshort))` available silver eel time series, only `r length(unique(d.cpue$ser_nameshort))` were kept for the trend analysis (Table \@ref(tab:table-kept)). From the `r nrow(t.filterchoice[t.filterchoice$filtered == "Dropped",])` time series that were excluded, `r nrow(t.filterchoice[t.filterchoice$reason.dropped == "Inconsistencies in data",])` showed inconsistencies in data and `r nrow(t.filterchoice[t.filterchoice$n < min.length,])` were excluded because they did not have `r min.length` consecutive years of effort data (Table \@ref(tab:table-dropped)).

The `r length(unique(d.cpue$ser_nameshort))` silver eel time series which were used in the analysis represented six ICES ecoregions (Figure \@ref(fig:mapsilverkept)). The Western Mediterranean Sea and Aegean-Levantine Sea only had one time series. The most represented areas were the Greater North Sea with 8 time series and the Baltic Sea with 7 time series. 11 ecoregions (Adriatic Sea, Arctic Ocean, Azores, Barents Sea, Black Sea, Faroes, Greenland Sea, Icelandic Waters, Ionian Sea and the Central Mediterranean Sea, Norwegian Sea, Oceanic Northeast Atlantic) did not have silver eel time series which were used in the trend analysis. All coastal time series used in the analysis are located in the Baltic Sea ecoregion. Freshwater series are located across 4 different ecoregions (Baltic Sea, Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Celtic Seas, Greater North Sea) and the transitional series are located in 2 ecoregions (Aegean-Levantine Sea, Western Mediterranean Sea).

Figure \@ref(fig:figure-series) gives an overview of the reported data for each silver eel time series that were kept for the trend analysis. Among the kept series, the number of available data points was highest between 2010 and 2021, with the peak in 2013-2017 (Figure \@ref(fig:figure-nseries)). The majority of the kept time series did not have 2023 data ready at the time of writing this report. Given the scarcity of data before 1980, analyses were down excluded data before that date.
