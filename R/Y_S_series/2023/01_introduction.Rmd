## Yellow and silver eel time series

### Summary

### Introduction

Compared to the current glass eel index where a common trend for all areas can be produced, for silver and yellow eel time series, one common trend for all series cannot be assumed for various reasons. Some of these reasons include, but are not limited to, varying age at maturation/silvering, varying natural and anthropogenic mortality.

Only one stage was examined here in this exploratory analysis. Silver eels can be considered a proxy for future spawners biomass/abundance, and was therefore analysed in detail. The analysis on yellow eel time series will be completed in the future, taking advantage of the methods and results from the silver eel analysis.

Two objectives can be assigned to the analysis: (i) define conservation status of silver eel, i.e., is the population (future spawners) sufficiently numerous to avoid extinction in the (near) future and (ii) find patterns, i.e., are there common trends among the series, can we define groups of series that share similar trends. Achieving the second objective (patterns) is useful for achieving the first (conservation status) but is also useful for identifying any spatial structure for the future spatial model  [@icesWorkshopFutureEel2021].

Patterns can be explored among different metrics (e.g. abundance, mean length, ...). The work presented here focuses on abundance, as this metrics is the one most related to conservation status and the primary results of a spatial model.

We first review the potential methods and decide the ecological and biological assumptions needed so that the correct analysis and predictors can be chosen.
