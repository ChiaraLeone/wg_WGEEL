# Introduction
Several time series of abundance of yellow eels and silver eels are collected
throughout Europe. However, the analysis of their trends is more complex than
for glass eel time series since yellow and silver eels abundances are the results of
both the general status of the population and local conditions (environmental
condition, anthropogenic pressures, life history traits, management actions,...)
in localities in which they are collected [@ices2014]. Despite these
difficulties, it is interesting to explore whether some common trends exist
among the available time series and whether they can be related to some factors,
especially whether some spatial patterns exist in these trends. This would be a first
exploration step before moving forward in a potential assessment of the standing
stock. In this context, we carry out a Dynamic Factor Analysis, a multivariate
method aiming at detecting common trends in a set of time series [@zuur2003a].
Such an exercise is worthwhile only when the number of available time series is important, 
therefore, we restricted this analysis to the recent period (post 2000) and focus
on recent trends. To complete the overview, we carried out GAM analyses on a longer period
(since 1975) to analyse the long-term trends. The trends were analysed separately for yellow and 
silver eels. The analysis is based on the time series of yellow and silver eel (standing stock) 
time series of abundance collected during the successive WGEEL Data Calls and 
contribute to the response to ToR b “Report on developments in the state of the European eel
(*Anguilla anguilla*) stock, the fisheries on it and other anthropogenic impacts”.

# Yellow eel
## Available data
`r length(unique(yellow_dataall$ser_id))` time series (out of `r nb_yellow`) provide data of quality 1, 2 or are
not rated through the current or past Data Call (Figure \@ref(fig:mapyellow)), originating from
`r length(unique(yellow_dataall$ser_cou_code))` countries and `r length(unique(yellow_dataall$ser_emu_nameshort))` EMUs.
See chapter **XXX** for a more comprehensive description of dataseries available.
<!--  Most of them are located in Great Britain or France. -->
<!-- `r length(unique(yellow_dataall$ser_id[yellow_dataall$ser_hty_code=="C"])) +  length(unique(yellow_dataall$ser_id[yellow_dataall$ser_hty_code=="MO"]))` -->
<!-- time series are collected in open sea or in coastal waters, -->
<!-- `r length(unique(yellow_dataall$ser_id[yellow_dataall$ser_hty_code=="T"]))` in transitional waters and -->
<!-- `r length(unique(yellow_dataall$ser_id[yellow_dataall$ser_hty_code=="F"]))` in freshwater. -->

<!-- à voir pour faire les stat : yellow_dataall %>% select(ser_id, ser_hty_code) %>% distinct() %>% group_by(ser_hty_code) %>% count() -->

```{r mapyellow, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of available yellow time series. Updated time series correspond to time series for which at least one value was provided for years the three last years",fig.height=14/2.54}

#knitr::include_graphics("images/yellow.png")
```

## Trends after 2000

```{r plot-nb-series-yellow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Number of yellow eel time series available per year", fig.height=8/2.54}

(point_per_year_YE = yellow_dataall %>%
	mutate(id = ser_id, year = das_year) %>%
	plot_nb_observation())

point_per_year_YE = point_per_year_YE$data
```

```{r data-gam-yellow, echo = FALSE}

yellow_data_gam = yellow_dataall %>% 
	mutate(id = ser_id, year = das_year, value = das_value) %>%
	select_data(yearBegin = 1975, yearEnd = current_year-1, freq_maxi0 = 0.1)

yellow_data = yellow_dataall %>% 
	mutate(id = ser_id, year = das_year, value = das_value) %>% 
	select_data(yearBegin = 2000, yearEnd = current_year-1, freq_maxi0 = 0.1)

```

Currently, few pre-2000 data are recorded in the database (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-nb-series-yellow)), 
an effort should be made in the future to collect historical data. Many data values for `r current_year` were still missing when
carrying out the analysis (only `r point_per_year_YE %>% filter(year == current_year) %>% pull()` series have data for
`r current_year`). 

In view of this, the analysis was restricted to the period ranging from 2000 to 
`r current_year -1` with data series that have at least 10 observations on the period.

This leaves `r length(unique(yellow_data$ser_id))` time series (and restricted to series having less than 10% of 0). 
If we plot all the series, a GAM smoother indicates an overall decreasing trend (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-GAM-yellow)).

```{r plot-GAM-yellow, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Yellow eel time series and GAM smoother"}

(plot_smooth_gam_yellow = plot_smooth_gam(yellow_data))

```

```{r gam-yellow, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Trends per country in yellow eel abundance estimated by a GAM"}

yellow_data_std = plot_smooth_gam_yellow$data

# test for trends per country
modelised_data = yellow_data_std %>%
	mutate(country = factor(ser_cou_code, levels = country_ref$cou_code, ordered=TRUE))

gam_country = GAM_series(modelised_data)

plot_GAM_series(mymodel = gam_country, variable = "country", modelised_data)

```

When plotted per country, a simple GAM smoother (explained deviance = `r round(summary(gam_country)$dev.expl * 100, 1)` %) shows
decreasing and stabilising curves in FR, NL. The same with a more pronounced increase after 2012 is estimated for ES (DK
seems to display a similar trend but the time series is shorter). On the other hand, a linear decrease is estimated in
IE, GB and DE, and an increase for SE (Figure \@ref(fig:gamYellow)).

### Running the DFA
The DFA method is fully detailed in [@zuur2003]. The basic idea is to decompose each time series into a weighted sum of a few common trends and a noise factor:
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{j,t}=\mu_j + \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i,j} \cdot X_{i,t} +\epsilon_{j,t} \qquad \mbox{ with } \left \{ \epsilon_{j,t} \right \}  \sim N(0,\Sigma)
\end{aligned}
$$
with $Y_{j, t}$ the value of the series $j$ at time $t$, $\mu_j$ an intercept, $n$ the number of common trends, $w_{i, j}$ the weight of trend $i$ in the series $j$, $X_{i,t}$ the value of trend $i$ at time $t$ and $\epsilon_{j,t}$ a normal noise, potentially correlated between series through the variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$ . Therefore, $X_{i,t}$ represent the trends common to the series and are modelled as random walks:

$$
\begin{aligned}
X_{i,t}=X_{i,t-1}+f_{i,t} \qquad \mbox{ with } f_{i,t} \sim N(0,Q)
\end{aligned}
$$

with $f_{i,t}$ the noise on the trend $i$ at time $t$ which follows a normal law, possibly correlated between trends with the variance-covariance matrix $Q$ which can be set to the identity matrix [@zuur2003a].
The method thus allows both to extract the common trends through the estimates of $X$, but also to see the importance of each trend in each series through $w$.

To fit the DFA, the user as to put some additional constraints. We will make 3 kinds of assumptions on $\Sigma$:

* $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix with equal elements in the diagonal (e.g. time series are independent with similar values of noise)
* $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix with unequal elements in the diagonal (e.g. time series are independent with different values of noise)
* $\Sigma$ is an unconstrained (e.g. time series are potentially not independent with different values of noise). This solution was not tested for yellow eels since the number of time series was too large compared to the number of observations.

One to 4 common trends are tested. The best combination of $\Sigma$ and number of trends is chosen by comparing AIC criteria. 
Before running the DFA, values were logtransformed (few 0 values were recorded and were replaced by 10% of the lower value of the series) and scales ((mean deleted and divided by the standard deviation)).


### Common trends

```{r dfa-yellow, results='hide',eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if (params$rerunDFA_yellow){
  #replace 0 value
  list_zeros <- which(yellow_data$das_value == 0)
  for (i in list_zeros){
    ser_id=yellow_data$ser_id[i]
    yellow_data$das_value[i] <- 0.2 *
      min(yellow_data$das_value[yellow_data$das_value>0 & 
                                  yellow_data$ser_id == ser_id],na.rm=TRUE)
  }
	
  # put data in wide format
	data_dfa_yellow = yellow_data %>% as_tibble() %>%
	  select(ser_nameshort,das_value,das_year) %>%
	  arrange(das_year)%>%
	  pivot_wider(names_from= ser_nameshort, values_from=das_value)
  s
	# plot yellow data series
  graph_serie(yellow_data)
  
  #Design of experiments
  S=c("diagonal and equal","diagonal and unequal")
  nbtrend=1:4
  expe=expand.grid(S=S,nbtrend=nbtrend)

  #Now we make a loop of DFA to find the best model
	DFA_yellow = run_DFA(data_dfa_yellow, expe, log = TRUE)

	# save results
	save(DFA_yellow, file="./dfayellow.rdata")

} else {
	load("./dfayellow.rdata")
}
```

One trends was estimated after selection by AICc criteria (Table \@ref(tab:comparisonYE) and Figure \@ref(fig:trendsyellow)).

```{r comparisonYE,echo=FALSE,tab.cap='Model comparisons for yellow eel DFA'}
table_summary_models(summary_models(DFA_yellow)) # Model comparison
```


```{r trendsyellow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Estimated common trends in yellow eel time series"}
#graph_summary_models(summary_models(DFA_yellow))
DFA = best_DFA(DFA_yellow) # results for best
DFA_results = results_DFA(DFA) # can be long
graph_trends(DFA_results$trends, year = sort(unique(yellow_data$das_year)), sign_trends = -1)

```

```{r tab-loadingsYE,echo=FALSE,tab.cap="Factor loadings of the yellow eel DFA (red names stand for loadings absolute values greater than 0.2)"}

graph_Z(DFA_results$Z.conf, sign_trends=-1) 

```

Trend 1 shows a monotonous decreasing trend over the period.

The factor loadings $w$ are displayed in the following plots (Figure \@ref(fig:seriesloadingsYE)). Following @zuur2003,
we only focused on loading with absolute values greater than 0.2 to focus on the most important trends and presented on
a Venn diagram (Figure \@ref(fig:vennyellow))

Many series are positively correlated to Trend 1, indicating a constant decline 
of abundance since the 2000s (Figure \@ref(fig:vennyellow)). Some time series are
negatively correlated to trend 1, but among them, many are also positively
correlated to trend 2, indicating a slight increase or stability at the beginning
of the period and then a decrease till 2007. Regarding time series dominated
mostly by a negative correlation with trend 1 (i.e. a monotonic increase over the
period), they all came from Great Britain, and half of them are located far from
the coast. On the whole, it is difficult to distinguish any clear spatial pattern
in the trends (Figures \@ref(fig:spatialpatternAllYE) and 
\@ref(fig:spatialpatternTrendsYE)).

The fits of the DFA model to the different time series are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:fitsyellow)

```


## Historical trends
We also fitted GAM over a period starting in 1975 to put the post-2000
trends in an historical perspective. For many countries, data do not start before the 2000s, so the reader should refer
to the previous section (DE, DK, ES, FR). A decreasing trend is observed in most other countries
(NL, NO, IE, GB) except in Sweden where an increasing trend is observed  (Figure \@ref(fig:gamYellowHist)) though
the early trend is only based on two time series.

```{r gamYellowHist, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Trends per country in yellow eel abundance estimated by a GAM "}
yellow_data_std_gam=yellow_data_gam%>%
  mutate(das_value=das_value)%>%
  group_by(ser_nameshort)%>%
  mutate(das_value=(das_value-mean(ifelse(das_year>=2000,
                                          das_value,
                                          NA),na.rm=TRUE))/sd(ifelse(das_year>=2000,
                                          das_value,
                                          NA),na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
						  mutate(id = ser_id, year = das_year, value = das_value, country = factor(ser_cou_code, levels = country_ref$cou_code, ordered=TRUE))

Similarly to yellow eels, few pre-2000 data series are available in the database (Figure \@ref(fig:pointperyearSE)).
Many data values for `r current_year` were still missing when carrying out the analysis (only
`r point_per_year_SE %>% filter(year == current_year) %>% pull()` series have data for `r current_year`). 

In
view of this, we restricted the analysis to the period 2000 to `r current_year - 1`, with time series having at least 10 observations
over the period. 

This leaves `r length(unique(silver_data$ser_id))` time series. If we plot all
the series, a GAM smoother indicates an overall slightly decreasing trend (Figure
\@ref(fig:plotTSSE)).


```{r plot-GAM-silver,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Silver eel time series and GAM smoother"}

(plot_smooth_gam_silver = plot_smooth_gam(silver_data))

```

When plotted per country, a simple GAM smoother shows decreasing trend in DK,
FR, NO, the same but with a stabilization in GB (Figure \@ref(fig:gamSilver)).
SE and ES display rather increasing trend, while IE is more stable. DE is
erratic, especially because there are no data at the beginning of the period.
The trend correspdond to log transformed and scaled values.

```{r gam-silver, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Trends per country in silver eel abundance estimated by a GAM"}

silver_data_std = plot_smooth_gam_silver$data

modelised_data = silver_data_std %>%
	mutate(country = factor(ser_cou_code, levels = country_ref$cou_code, ordered=TRUE))

gam_country = GAM_series(modelised_data)

plot_GAM_series(mymodel = gam_country, variable = "country", modelised_data)

```


```{r table-silver-gam, echo=FALSE, tab.cap = "Series included in the GAM analysis"}
GAM_sumarry_table(silver_data_std)
```

### Running the DFA
We applied the same method as for yellow eels so readers can refer to the 
corresponding section for further details.

### Common trends

```{r dfa-silver, results='hide',eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if (params$rerunDFA_silver){
	#replace 0 value
	list_zeros <- which(silver_data$das_value == 0)
	for (i in list_zeros){
		ser_id=silver_data$ser_id[i]
		silver_data$das_value[i] <- 0.2 *
			min(silver_data$das_value[silver_data$das_value>0 & 
						silver_data$ser_id == ser_id],na.rm=TRUE)
	}
  # put data in wide format
  	data_dfa_silver = silver_data %>% as_tibble() %>%
	  select(ser_nameshort,das_value,das_year) %>%
	  arrange(das_year)%>%
	  pivot_wider(names_from= ser_nameshort, values_from=das_value)
  
  	# plot raw data series
  	graph_serie(silver_data)
  
  
  
  #Design of experiments
  S=c("diagonal and equal","diagonal and unequal")
  nbtrend=1:4
  expe=expand.grid(S=S,nbtrend=nbtrend)

  #Now we make a loop of DFA to find the best model
	DFA_silver = run_DFA(data_dfa_silver, expe, log = TRUE)
	
	# save results
	save(DFA_silver, file="./dfasilver.rdata")

} else {
	load("./dfasilver.rdata")
}
```
  
The model selection leads to the estimation of a single trend (Table
\@ref(tab:comparisonSE) and Figure \@ref(fig:trendssilver)).


```{r comparisonSE,echo=FALSE,tab.cap="Model comparisons for silver eel DFA"}

table_summary_models(summary_models(DFA_silver))

```
  
  
```{r trendssilver, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Estimated common trend in silver eel time series"}
#graph_summary_models(summary_models(DFA_silver))
DFA = best_DFA(DFA_silver)
DFA_results = results_DFA(DFA) # can be long
graph_trends(DFA_results$trends,year=sort(unique(silver_data$das_year)),sign_trends=-1)

```
  
 
```{r tab-loadingsSE,echo=FALSE,tab.cap="Factor loadings of the silver eel DFA (red names stand for loadings absolute values greater than 0.2)"}

graph_Z(DFA_results$Z.conf, sign_trends=-1) 

``` 
  
The factor loadings are displayed in the Figure \@ref(fig:seriesloadingssilver) 
(importance of each trend in each time series) and corresponding Venn diagram in Figure \@ref(fig:vennsilver).
  
```{r seriesloadingssilver, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Factor loadings of the silver eel DFA"}
#TODO
```


```{r vennsilver, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Venn diagram of the silver eel DFA"}
Venn_silver = Venn_diagram(DFA_results$Z, sign_trends=-1)
Venn_silver$plot
```


```{r spatialpatternAllSE, echo = FALSE,fig.cap="Spatial maps of silver DFA loadings (+ stands for a positive correlaction to trend 1)", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.heigth=16/2.54}

silver_group_Venn = Venn_silver$venn %>% 
	unlist_venn() %>%
	inner_join(silver_map) %>%
	rename(`Venn's group` = Venn_group)

map_series(silver_group_Venn, variable = "Venn's group", mapType = c("terrain-background"), transparent = FALSE, labels = FALSE, pch_cex = 3)

```


About `r #round(100*sum(silver_belonging$Trend=="Trend1+")/nrow(silver_belonging))`%
of the series are positively correlated to trend 1 indicating a decline in the
abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:seriesloadingssilver)). However, about 
`r #round(100*sum(silver_belonging$Trend=="Trend1-")/nrow(silver_belonging))`% 
are negatively correlated suggesting an increase, and about 
`r #round(100*sum(silver_belonging$Trend=="Any")/nrow(silver_belonging))`% are 
not correlated to any trends, suggesting some stability. As for yellow eels, 
there is no obvious spatial pattern in the trends 
(Figure \@ref(fig:spatialpatternAllSE)).

DFA fits to data are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:fitsilver).

```{r fitsilver, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Silver DFA fits to time series", fig.width=16/2.54, fig.height=16/2.54 }

series_trends_graph(DFA, colored_strip = FALSE)

```

## Historical trends

We also fitted GAM over a period starting in 1975 to put the post-2000
trends in an historical perspective. For Germany and Danemark, time series are short and the
reader should refer to the previous section. For Spain, Great Britain, Norway and Ireland, the abundances
are very low with respect to the late 1970s levels (Figure \@ref(fig:gamSilverHist)).
However, the dynamic is slightly different among countries:

* an early decrease in the late 1970s in IE or GB and then a relative stability
* a decrease in the late 1980s in Spain and then a period of stability or small increase
* a rather monotonic decrease in Norway

In France, an increase is observed in the 1980s and then decreased.
Finally, and similarly to yellow eels, Sweden is the only country displaying an increase
of abundance, especially after the 1980s. 

```{r gamSilverHist, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Trends per country in silver eel abundance estimated by a GAM"}
silver_data_std_gam=silver_data_gam%>%
  mutate(das_value=das_value)%>%
  group_by(ser_id)%>%
  mutate(das_value=(das_value-mean(ifelse(das_year>=2000,
                                          das_value,
                                          NA),na.rm=TRUE))/sd(ifelse(das_year>=2000,
                                          das_value,
                                          NA),na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
						  mutate(id = ser_id, year = das_year, value = das_value, country = factor(ser_cou_code, levels = country_ref$cou_code, ordered=TRUE))
					  

	g1 = GAM_series(silver_data_std_gam)
	
	plot_GAM_series(mymodel = g1, variable = "country", silver_data_std_gam, free_y = FALSE)

```




# Discussion / Conclusion
Yellow and silver eels time series of abundance have been collected in at least 14 countries
all over Europe for as long as nearly 1 century. This analysis is a first intent to analyse the 
provided data. As explained in the introduction, such as analysis is complex
du to the complexity of the life of the species and its fractal dimension during
the continental growth phase [@dekker2000a].

Two complementary analyses were used: a DFA analysis to depict common trends in the 
recent period and a GAM analysis on the long term. In the short term, while the majority
of the time series indicate a declining trend of abundance, this general picture hinders
very contrasted situations and increases of abundance of yellow eels and silver eels
have been observed in some river basins. This contrast is likely to be related to
different conditions (environmental conditions, anthropogenic pressures,
management practices) among river basins and there is no clear spatial pattern
in the trends. Interestingly, while a shift of trend was detected for yellow eel
around 2007 (trend 2), this shift occurred before or just after the implementation
of the Eel Regulation so that the Regulation cannot be the only direct cause. 
Various reasons may explain such a shift such as changes in management practices,
changes in monitoring protocol in anticipation or in response to Eel Management 
Plan, but also changes in local environmental conditions. On the
whole, since other trends are nearly monotonic, it suggests that the Eel
Regulation has not led to major changes in the abundance of yellow and 
silver eels in these basins, but this is not necessarily a surprise since the growth phase 
last from 5 to 20 years depending on the habitats and sex [@vollestad1992].

The few available time series allow to put the recent trends into an historical perspective. 
Though results on the long old time should be taken with caution given the limited
time series, most of them display a decreasing trend since the 1975. Some variations
exist among countries. While the decrease starts as soon as the beginning of the period
in many countries, the decrease appears to start later in Spain. As such, it would have
occured about 5 years after the decline in recruitment, i.e. about the duration of the 
growth phase in southern Europe. France also shows an increase at the beginning of the time
series, but data only started in the mid 80s, so it is impossible to conclude for older years.
Moreover, this increase is concomitant with some increasing oscillations, for example in Ireland,
so this may have been a temporary situation. Sweden display atypical increasing trends compared
to other countries. It is difficult to conclude on the reasons of these trends, but we can 
suggest that fishery closure in Western Sweden may have played a role, and restocking may also
have played a role (though it occurs mainly in Inland EMUs).

As a first analysis, the results do provide a very partial overview of what have indeed happened. It would be worthwhile
collecting more series and carrying out further analysis to understand the reasons of these different trends. More
specifically, it would be interesting to analyse whether the distance to the sea (data
not available currently) plays a role in the results. Other factors, such as monitoring
method or particular management measure (restocking, barrier’s mitigation, fishery closure, …) may also be analysed. As a next step, it would be worthwhile comparing trends with
recruitment and mortalities estimates in each EMU.
