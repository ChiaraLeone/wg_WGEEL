This tool is similar to a trawl net, 9 m wide, 5 m high and 22 to 25 m long, with decreasing mesh sizes (120 mm at the entrance to 20 mm at the end) extended by a removable pocket where silver eels can be caught. But unlike the trawl, the boat and the guideau remain motionless, held against the current by a strong anchoring and cable system. The fishing data collected are the catches expressed in number of eels and the fishing effort corresponds to a fishing night, The fishing period, which corresponds to the legal period, begins on October 1 and ends on February 15. | Professional fisheries ; partial, escapement evaluated for some year by MNHN";"trapping partial";"index";"stow net"
