# General notes

Some files are in WGEEL accession, the rest have been collected by Jan Dag

https://community.ices.dk/ExpertGroups/wgeel/WGEEL%20accessions/Data%20call%202019/Eel_Data_Call_Annex1_Recruitment.xlsx
=> nothing, don't know what country it is.

* **NOTE**  For recruitment check that series now > 10 years are included
* **NOTE**  There is nothing in our sheets to enter data for the station table, for next year insert a sheet with fields <br/>
			ref.tr_station( "tblCodeID",<br/>
			"Station_Code",<br/>
			"Country",--'country responsible of the data collection ?'<br/> 
			"Organisation",<br/>
			"Station_Name",<br/>
			"WLTYP",--'Water and land station types ';<br/> 
			"Lat",<br/>
			"Lon",<br/>
			"StartYear",<br/>
			"EndYear",<br/>
			"PURPM",'Purpose of monitoring http://vocab.ices.dk/?ref=1399'<br/>
			"Notes") <br/>
* **NOTE**  The reference list for emu is wrong in landings original file, it should not integrate outside emu, there is a script to generate referential tables, run it to provide the right references during wgeel
* **NOTE**  INTEGRATION PROCEDURE I've checked, if you don't intend to keep any data in duplicates excel file you don't need to put a code in `eel_qal_id` weel you can but it will be replace by `qualify_code (19)` taken from `global.R`. In fact you only need to qualify the lines that you want (`keep_new_value=TRUE`).

## DENMARK

### Recruitment 

* *MISSING*  I need png 300x225px for all Danish stations to illustrate in shiny.
 ** => new series Hellebaekken**


* *CHECK* I guess the `ser_uni_cod` is number (nr). It was left blank in the description file.
* *CHECK* My guess is that the trap is in transitional waters is it TRUE ?
* *CHECK*  The organisation doing the monitoring is DTU Aqua ? this is necessary for the station table for ICES
* **NOTE**  This series will be named hell :-) !		
* **NOTE** Cannot use the effort as it stands, it should be a numeric, with effort, so I'm putting the season monitored which never changes (total season 1 april-1 november) into the series description.
* *CHECK* Biometry 70-100 mm is a text not a numeric what should I do ?

  
  
NorsA Klet Sle


*  *CHECK* description edited : Average densities (eel/m2) of pigmented glas eel and yellow eel (elvers)  from three electro surveys from may to august . The data represent in general 3 electrofishing surveys per season. Some years only one or two  electrofishing surveys have been possible. The max density is usally found in June/July. 
*  *CHECK* locationdescription edited : Electrofishing in a small stream. 
*  *CHECK* No new data ? 


			
** Harte **
OK


### Landings

The values `DK_outside_emu` should be replace by `DK_total`, it was decided to remove all outside emu data,
corrected uppercase hty, added cou_code, removed area from freshwater, no duplicates

```
column <eel_emu_nameshort>, line <4>, value <DK_outside_emu> is wrong 
column <eel_emu_nameshort>, line <5>, value <DK_outside_emu> is wrong 
column <eel_emu_nameshort>, line <6>, value <DK_outside_emu> is wrong 
column <eel_cou_code>, missing values line 1 
 column <eel_cou_code>, missing values line 2 
 column <eel_cou_code>, missing values line 3 
 column <eel_cou_code>, missing values line 4 
 column <eel_cou_code>, missing values line 5 
 column <eel_cou_code>, missing values line 6 
column <eel_hty_code>, line <4>, value <c> is wrong 
 column <eel_hty_code>, line <5>, value <c> is wrong 
 column <eel_hty_code>, line <6>, value <c> is wrong 
 line <1>, there should not be any area divsion in freshwater 
 line <2>, there should not be any area divsion in freshwater 
 line <3>, there should not be any area divsion in freshwater
 ```
 
###  Release
 
 ```
 release 
column <eel_emu_nameshort>, missing values line 4 
 column <eel_emu_nameshort>, missing values line 5 
 column <eel_emu_nameshort>, missing values line 6 
line <1>, there should not be any area divsion in freshwater 
 line <2>, there should not be any area divsion in freshwater 
 line <3>, there should not be any area divsion in freshwater 
 ```
 
* **NOTE** There are 3 lines for Dk_Inla but only one EMU, you cannot have area division in Freshwater, 
 so I've added the 3 lines.

* **NOTE**  MARIA or Esti praise for you for spotting the wrong `eel_area_division` the best was to remove those lines
 and re-inserting again.
 
 
```sql
  BEGIN;
DELETE FROM datawg.t_eelstock_eel  where eel_area_division in ('37.1.2','37.1.3') and eel_cou_code='ES';
COMMIT;
```
* **NOTE** Value for datacall 2019 was dc_2019 => corrected

```
13 new values inserted in the database
For duplicates 6 values replaced in the database (old values kept with code eel_qal_id=19),
            0 values not replaced (values from current datacall stored with code eel_qal_id 19)
```

### Release
 
* **NOTE** All names should be `release_n`, it's later on that the script will split up the two columns `release_n` and `release_kg`
* *CHECK* You have values for 2020 I this is obviously a mistake, I changed to 2019 correct ?

* **NOTE** The last line is a duplicate fom previous line but with values wrong (57 kg glass eel is about 17000 not 170000 + this was the 2020 line ... I'm dropping this line.

## FINLAND

### Landings

* **NOTE** Changed emu name to FI_total otherwise it's creating duplicates
* **NOTE** Removed wrong entries NC where no data, changed 2018 value in recreational landings to ND (the alternative could have been not to report any data.
* **CHECK** Changed type `com_landings` to `other_landings`in Landings in Freshwater with comment as "Trap and transport" fish from freshwater to the sea in one location, otherwise 0 kg. I've checked the value in landings in Freshwater from 2014 to 2018 corresponding to those lines. It was 0 for 2014 and then NULL and marked either as `not collected` or `not reported` or zero. So there will not be any duplicates for those data and these line will stay in the database. I think it's OK but please check.
* **NOTE**  When checking the duplicates, there is no change in the data, so I will not update the database. You didn't have to report data that were already in, next year we will again provide you the data as they are in the database, please use that to check and only ask for corrections. The table reports that there is no data in 2018 though we will integrate one line with ND.

SERIES INFO

I have modified your comments so please check :

* Dala **CHECK** Comment : "Ascending yellow eels of about 40 cm caught in an eel pass placed close to a hydro power complex. This series started in 1951."  
       **NOTE** Ser_location_description Hydro power station 10 km from the river mouth, this site is the farthest site into the Baltic
       
* Gota **CHECK** Comment: "Operated since 1900, this series is the longest available to the working group
Missing years 1995, 1998 to 2001, 2010,2011 (fish pass rebuilt in 2010 2011). The station collects ascending yellow eels of different sizes caught in an eel pass placed close to a hydro power station."
       **NOTE** Ser_location_description updated
       
* Kavl  **CHECK** location : "Near the Ãresund (Sound) strait, outlet of Lake VombsjÃ¶n 45 km from the sea."
        **CHECK** Ascending small eels caught in an eel pass.

* Laga   **CHECK** Swedish west coast, hydropower station ca 10 km from the sea.
         **CHECK** Ascending small eels caught in an eel pass at a hydro power station. Though classified as a yellow eel series, there is always a high percentage of YOY elvers from this site.
         
* Morr  **CHECK** location : Station located on the MÃ¶rrumÃ¥n river flowing to the southern coast of Sweden, the station is quite far upstream the river. 
          **CHECK** comment : Ascending yellow eels at a hydro power station. The series is complete since 1960.
          
* Mota    **CHECK**  location  Eel pass located at a hydro power station near the outlet of Lake VÃ¤ttern, second largest lake by surface area in Sweden. This lake is flowing into the Baltic about a 100 km south from Stockholm.    
           **CHECK** comment :  As this site is both far upstream and far into the Baltic, ascending yellow eels are quite large (30-40) cm. This series is one of the longest series available to wgeel, with a complete series dating back to 1942.
           

           

    


* YFS2 **CHECK** comment is  "Skagerrak-KattegatCatch of glass eels by a modified MethotâIsaacsâKidd Midwater trawl (MIKT) in the Skagerrak-Kattegat. Data expressed as total numbers per hour of haul. No sampling in 2011 due to technical problems". 
         **NOTE** Ser_location_description updated according to your data
