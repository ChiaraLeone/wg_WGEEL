### Recruitment 

* *MISSING*  I need png 300x225px for all Danish stations to illustrate in shiny.
 ** => new series Hellebaekken**


* *CHECK* I guess the `ser_uni_cod` is number (nr). It was left blank in the description file.
* *CHECK* My guess is that the trap is in transitional waters is it TRUE ?
* *CHECK*  The organisation doing the monitoring is DTU Aqua ? this is necessary for the station table for ICES
* **NOTE**  This series will be named hell :-) !		
* **NOTE** Cannot use the effort as it stands, it should be a numeric, with effort, so I'm putting the season monitored which never changes (total season 1 april-1 november) into the series description.
* *CHECK* Biometry 70-100 mm is a text not a numeric what should I do ?

  
  
NorsA Klet Sle


*  *CHECK* description edited : Average densities (eel/m2) of pigmented glas eel and yellow eel (elvers)  from three electro surveys from may to august . The data represent in general 3 electrofishing surveys per season. Some years only one or two  electrofishing surveys have been possible. The max density is usally found in June/July. 
*  *CHECK* locationdescription edited : Electrofishing in a small stream. 
*  *CHECK* No new data ?
