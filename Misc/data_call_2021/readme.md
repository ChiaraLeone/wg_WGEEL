Annex 3 - New data is not new (rather an update?)
Annex 4 - Why is Schl updated, it did not change, did it?
Annex 5 - e.g. 425800 updated but only quality changes... This is not for the provider to change, is it?
Annex 7 - no kg provided, but is it needed? for what? only useful for Y / S and this is where it is probably not very accurate, is it?

Question about DK_total

Concerning the annex 15 of the data call. 
In general DK has one EMU which is DK_Inla additional there is an obtion  DK_total (that is used by me as a management unit covering all marine areas). But in annex 15 there is no DK_total option

There is isn't it ?

You can use it. This is for the management units
