Annex 4 (by GFCM) - missing area divisions

Annex 7 (by GFCM) - silver eel releases... T&T? Captured in catches? Someting else? There is no n_release, so it doesn't work. Error: object 'release_tot' not found

Annex 12 (by GFCM)

# BE

# DE
Annex 3 - New data is not new (rather an update?)
Annex 4 - Why is Schl updated, it did not change, did it?
Annex 5 - e.g. 425800 updated but only quality changes... This is not for the provider to change, is it?
Annex 7 - no kg provided, but is it needed? for what? only useful for Y / S and this is where it is probably not very accurate, is it?


# DK
Question about DK_total

Concerning the annex 15 of the data call. 
In general DK has one EMU which is DK_Inla additional there is an obtion  DK_total (that is used by me as a management unit covering all marine areas). But in annex 15 there is no DK_total option

There is isn't it ?

You can use it. This is for the management units

remove data per habitat for aquaculture (in existing kept there are values for Freshwater, this is wrong.) These values are duplicated with values entered for 2017 without the Freshwater tag. Suggestion = remove all data for aquaculture and Freshwater and update the rest if wrong

CÃ©dric : You cannot report other_landings there, it's fine if you put two lines in other landings instead, one for numbers and one for kilograms.
32	other_landings_kg	This is neither recreational fishery, nor commercial fishery, for example catching a quantity of eel at a trapping ladder below a dam can be qualitied as other_landings, the exact purpose should be provided in the corresponding comment
